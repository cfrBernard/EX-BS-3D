## 🏀 Project Overview
This project is a small physics-based basketball arcade game, made as a first experiment with Unity 3D. It was developed solo in under a week, with a focus on game feel, polish, and rapid iteration.

While the code is open source, the full Unity project isn’t — it relies on a private submodule for assets (sounds, models, particles, etc.). The codebase remains accessible for learning or inspiration.

### ⚠️A Word of Warning
Due to time constraints and learning goals, the project uses a single-scene setup with a variety of purpose-specific scripts — some of which are... let’s say creative 😅. There’s no event system, no multi-scene management, and minimal abstraction. Consider it a snapshot of fast-paced prototyping rather than a clean architecture.
